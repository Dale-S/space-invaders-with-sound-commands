# space-invaders-with-sound-commands
This was a project that I worked on with another student, Dylan Ignacio, as a project for the CSSIx program. 
This is a sort of space invaders clone with some very basic sound commands.
We put a nice spin on space invaders by adding sound detection, the game isn't identical to space invaders but the concept is similar. 
For the sound detection, you must have your mic enabled on the webpage and the keyword is bang or bam.
If you say either of those words it will make your spaceship shoot, as for movement it is with the arrow keys.
If you do not wish to use the sound controls the up arrow will allow you to shoot.
In order to run this on your computer, it is on repl.it as a public project to test, that can be found at this link: https://repl.it/talk/share/Space-Invaders-With-Sound-Detection/47830.
If you don't want to play it on repl you can download the repository and open the index.html in a web browser.
